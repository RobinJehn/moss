1. Model the producers as Companies that want to maximize profit
   1. Producers have a capital, it goes up and down depending on the amount of energy that is being bought from them
2. Model the producers as being able to expand capacity
   1. Every timestep they determine whether they want to expand or not
   2. When they decide to expand, they start spending a portion of the cost until the capacity increase is completed. Only then will the capacity actually increase
3. Model decision making, e.g. subsidies etc.
   1. Money per kWH capacity build
   2. Money per kWH sold
4. Add maintenance cost
5. Model decreasing capacity
6. Model demand increasing over time

Expected behaviour for our model: The cheapest energy producer will end up saturating the entire grid
